# contacts-app

Contacts web application created with HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Express.js and EJS.

*** Summary *** 

The app has a form which asks for contact details. After user enters the deatils, I have used body-parser mdoule of Node.js which reads the data on form submission. I have then pushed the data in array and displayed it in a card view with EJS.

App can be run with 'nodemon app.js' or 'node app.js' while in the root directory.
